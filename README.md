# MOCOMLab
## Modeling and Control of Manipulators Laboratory 

This repository contains the code developed during the course "Modeling and Control of Manipulators", held at University of Genoa, Italy, as part of the Robotics Engineering Master.

The objective of the laboratory was to extrapolate the DH parameters from an existing design of a robotic arm, in order to be able then to compute the Direct Geometric Model and the Forward Kinematics needed to implement a simple Closed Loop inverse Kinematic (CLIK) control scheme.

The code was produced by Enrico Casagrande, Nicola De Carli and Claudio Curti in December 2018.
